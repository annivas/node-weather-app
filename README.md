# Weather App

http://annivas-weather-application.herokuapp.com/


This web application provides a simple weather description for a given location.

<br/>

It uses the mapbox [geocoding API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/) to get the coordinates for the searched location.

These coordinates are fed into the [weatherstack API](https://weatherstack.com/) to fetch weather information.
